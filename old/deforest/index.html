                 data-text2="Soil erosion and degradation: Removing forest cover exposes soil to erosion by wind and water, leading to soil degradation, reduced fertility, and increased sedimentation in water bodies."
                 data-text3="Disruption of hydrological cycles: Deforestation alters the water cycle by reducing evapotranspiration, increasing runoff and flooding, and disrupting river flow and water quality."
