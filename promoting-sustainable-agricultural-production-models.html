                    Increasing the consumption and trade of responsibly-produced agricultural commodities can create win-wins for both the environment and sustainable economic development. Recent decades have seen a rapid increase in the demand for agricultural commodities, including those most commonly produced on recently deforested land. Driven by rapid population growth, urbanization, the ascent of a globalized economy, and a growing global middle class, dietary patterns have shifted towards higher overall food consumption and protein intake. To meet the increasing demand, agricultural production has expanded rapidly and particularly in the tropics, where the demand-side pressure for increased production led to the expansion of agricultural land, notably through the conversion of forests. Meanwhile, only limited market niches have integrated requirements for sustainable and responsible production. Consumer awareness and market requirements are relatively low compared to the overall size of the market for agricultural commodities.

                    In this context, mainstreaming more sustainable production and consumption patterns can make a real difference in achieving forest protection while contributing towards broader benefits for health, the environment, and sustainable development. Companies can take action in adopting responsible business practices and investing in traceability and transparency. Governments can adopt binding requirements for trading commodities linked to deforestation and align trade and biofuel policies with sustainability objectives. In addition, consumers can be incentivized to adapt their consumption patterns towards more sustainable choices.
